#Mongodb

MongoDB is a popular, open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database. It is designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data and allows for easy scalability and high performance.

MongoDB stores data in a format called BSON (binary JSON), which is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents. This means that MongoDB stores data in a format that is similar to JSON, but with additional data types and a more compact binary representation.

MongoDB allows for flexible and dynamic schema design, as it does not enforce a strict schema like traditional relational databases. This means that documents in a collection can have different fields, and fields can be added or removed without having to alter the entire collection.

MongoDB also offers built-in support for sharding, which is a method of distributing data across multiple servers to improve performance and scalability.

MongoDB's rich query language and support for secondary indexes and full-text search makes it a popular choice for web and mobile applications, real-time analytics, content management, and other use cases that require high performance and scalability.

Please note that, MongoDB is not a replacement for all use-cases, it's best for use-cases that require handling big unstructured data, real-time analytics and high scalability.
